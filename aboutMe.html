                    I was born in raised in Missouri. My father was a gamer and naturally, I was fascinated with everything that was video games.
                    By the age of 6 years old, I was playing on my father's PlayStation 2 playing all kinds of games.
                    <br /><br />My family was considered lower middle class since my dad worked a decent construction job.
                    <br /><br />At 9 years old, my parents separated and my mother got custody of my sister and I.

                    All the way back in elementary school, I was considered a 'gifted' student. I was quick to learn and especially liked math.
                    Ever since I was little, I always dreamed about building video games as a career.
                    <br /><br />Middle school and high school had too slow of a learning pace, so I took it apon myself to fulfill the craving to learn within myself.
                    <br /><br />Starting in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, I learned how to program in JavaScript. I started making simple applications to learn key concepts. In 12<sup>th</sup> grade, I was teaching my calculus class concepts that we would learn in the next chapter.
                    <br /><br />This has stayed the same all through high school and has shown its prevalence into college, as even while I am learning, I am striving to learn even more.
